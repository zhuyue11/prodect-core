// Email capture for E2E.
//
// The dev server runs with EMAIL_PROVIDER=file (set in playwright.config.ts's
// webServer.env), which appends each email as a JSON line to
// EMAIL_OUTBOX_PATH (default /tmp/prodect-test-emails.jsonl). This helper
// polls the file and returns the most recent email matching a recipient
// predicate.
//
// Why poll rather than tap stdout: Playwright's webServer API doesn't
// expose the spawned process's stdout to test code in a portable way. A
// file on disk is the cheapest cross-process IPC we can rely on.
//
// Why include EMAIL_OUTBOX_PATH default here too: tests are executed in
// the Playwright runner's process, not the dev server's, so the .env's
// EMAIL_OUTBOX_PATH isn't auto-loaded. Keep the default in lockstep with
// playwright.config.ts.
