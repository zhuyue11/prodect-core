// already owned :3000 — the parallel-worktree workflow the manual-merge mode
// assumes. Three things had to move off the fixed port together:
//   1. Playwright baseURL + webServer.url (below).
//   2. Better-Auth's CSRF origin guard — handled by passing BETTER_AUTH_URL
//      into webServer.env; lib/auth/index.ts already threads that through both
//      baseURL and trustedOrigins, so no auth-code change is needed.
//   3. reuseExistingServer — must be off when a custom port is requested, or a
//      worktree could silently reuse a sibling's :3000 server (wrong code).
// Usage from a worktree:  E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3100 pnpm test:e2e
// (or PORT=3100). Default stays :3000 so existing invocations are unchanged.
// E2E_BASE_URL is the single source of truth when set: the dev-server PORT is
// derived FROM it so the spawned server and the URL Playwright drives can't
// disagree (a bare E2E_BASE_URL with a stale PORT would otherwise boot the

/**
 * Playwright config for prodect-core's E2E auth smoke suite.
 *
 * Specs live in tests/e2e/. The webServer block spawns `pnpm dev` on
 * :3000 and waits for it to come up; in CI it's a fresh server per job,
 * locally it reuses an already-running dev server if one is up.
 *
 * Email delivery during E2E uses the dev-only 'file' provider from
 * lib/email.ts (see EMAIL_PROVIDER + EMAIL_OUTBOX_PATH below). The
 * specs read /tmp/prodect-test-emails.jsonl to capture reset links.
 *
 * Tagged-suite convention: tests in this Story carry an `@smoke` tag in
 * their describe/test titles. Playwright doesn't have first-class tag
 * filtering, but CI can use `--grep @smoke` (or set a `grep` here) to
 * filter when a later Story adds non-smoke specs.
 *
 * Workers are pinned to 1 because both specs touch the same auth tables
 * and `truncateAuthTables()` is global — parallel workers would race.
