// PRODECT_FINDINGS #3: `next build`'s "Collecting page data" step evaluates
// every route module — including pure server-handler routes that never touch
// Google — which transitively imports `lib/auth/index.ts` and runs its
// module-level `requiredEnv('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID' | 'GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET')`.
// A dev/CI/worktree checkout whose `.env` carries only DATABASE_URL then
// fails the build with a confusing "Failed to collect page data" error on a
// route that has zero coupling to Google.
//
// Fix: seed placeholder OAuth creds here so module-load `requiredEnv` checks
// pass during dev and `next build`. This file is evaluated by `next dev`,
// `next build`, AND the production server, so the injection MUST be gated to
// non-production — otherwise a genuinely-missing prod credential would be
// silently papered over with a placeholder instead of failing loud at the
// first /api/auth request (the property finding #3 explicitly wants to keep).
//
// The placeholders are inert build-time stand-ins: they only let module-load
// `requiredEnv` checks pass during `next build`'s page-data collection. They
// never authenticate against Google (no OAuth round-trip happens during a
// build). Gated to non-production so a production deploy that genuinely lacks
// the creds still fails loud at the first /api/auth request.
//
// This is purely a LOCAL build-DX fix and changes nothing on Vercel: both
// Production AND Preview targets carry real GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, so the
// `??=` never overwrites anything there. The branch only fires in local
// `git worktree` / CI builds whose hand-copied `.env` omits the OAuth vars
// (the scenario in PRODECT_FINDINGS #3) — those have NODE_ENV development/test,
// get placeholders, and `next build` collects page data cleanly instead of
// throwing on routes (e.g. /api/invites/[token]/accept) that never touch Google.
