# the LOCAL DEV password here, out of band, so the role can actually connect
# when we point a DATABASE_URL at it. This is the dev/CI password ONLY —
# production provisions prodect_app's credentials via its secret store / managed
# Postgres provider, never via this script. Idempotent: ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD
# is safe to re-run.
