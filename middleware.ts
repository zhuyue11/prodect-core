// validation is too expensive (DB call) and incompatible with Edge runtime
// in some Next versions. Each protected page/route still re-checks the
// session server-side via `getSession()` for actual enforcement.
//
// The matcher below targets the /app/(authed)/* route group. The (authed)
// segment is a Next.js route group — it groups files but doesn't add a
// URL segment — so its children are matched by their actual URL paths.
// We list those URL paths in `config.matcher` rather than trying to match
// the route-group name.
